This is a repo of my own C Decompiler for x86-64 binaries.
---
Currently it only supports disassembling user defined functions when compiling with symbols.

How to run:
---
just `make` it, exe is in `out` dir

Next features:
---
- Detecting functions using my own cool algo I will explain later.
- Division into Basic-Blocks.
- Start working on dataflow analysis.

- And much more :D
